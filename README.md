# lookThroughTunnel

lookThroughTunnel is a lightweight, high-performance desktop traffic interceptor for capturing, logging, and analyzing network traffic generated by desktop applications in real time.  
It targets a gap between generic packet sniffers and web-focused proxies by providing an extensible core that is specifically optimized for desktop applications (HTTP, HTTPS, UDP, custom protocols) with plugin-based analysis and optional interception transforms.

## Key features
- Real-time packet capture: Ethernet, IPv4/IPv6, TCP and UDP
- Human-friendly packet summaries: timestamp, src/dst IP & ports, protocol, length
- Interactive network interface selection and hot-switching
- Low-resource core implemented in C++ (libpcap / Npcap)
- Plugin-friendly architecture for protocol analyzers, exporters, and interceptors
- Planned export formats: PCAP, JSON
- Designed for security professionals, sysadmins, and devs who need focused analysis of desktop app traffic
